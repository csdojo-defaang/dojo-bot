# Development Plan

We're going to use JavaScript or TypeScript for this. [Discussion link](https://github.com/csdojo-defaang/dojo-bot/discussions/3)

## Step 1

Create a simple version of this bot. It'll only available on the dojo server.

## Step 2

Add more features. For example: encourage people to invite people to the server.

People should be able to gain points by inviting their friends.
